• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
  If we create a .gitignore file,it is used by Git to determine which files and directories should be ignored as we     
  make a commit.
  For a java project it should include the below:

# Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

# virtual machine crash logs
hs_err_pid*

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
  When we try to merge a commit with a commit that is reachable by following the 1st commit's history,git internally  
  simplifies this by just moving the pointer forward.This is called as fast-forward.

• Why should you have different branches?
  In a group work environment,it is quite common for several people to work on the same piece of source.For Ex:
  In a developer environment some will be fixing bugs,implementing new features,etc.Branching provides a system for       managing different versions of the code base.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
  In a large Project we can have more than 1 remote branches but only 1 origin.
